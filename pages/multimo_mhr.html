      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        With the advancement of robot platforms for complex tasks, a deeper understanding of how the system can traverse an environment is required. Two common strategies concentrate on terrestrial motion or aerial flight. This thesis explores an alternative locomotion strategy, hopping, requiring both a sturdy design to survive continuous ground impacts and to be highly agile for aerial maneuvering. This thesis explores high-performance, high-energy, and highly dynamic hopping up to 4 m, a task no other hopping robot has achieved; to date, excluding this work, the highest hopping robot attains a 1.63 m hop. Where low energy hopping generates easier control stabilization and limits the full range of potential for hopping. 
      </p>
      This dissertation culminates the exploration into this higher energy and dynamic region of hopping locomotion. A hopping robot, the MultiMo-MHR, was developed, capable of hopping up to 4 m while weighing 684 g and standing 369 mm tall. Designed with a singular monopedal hopping leg and a quadrotor-based motor configuration for control and energy input. The thesis is comprised of four main parts, starting with a detailed robot overview that explores both the background of hopping robots, the design, control, and experimental elements. The first study explores design principles and control design to optimize efficiency. Presenting both the high-performance robot as well as design and control principles for efficient hopping. To expand the capabilities of hopping systems, the subsequent study explored full vertical state estimation for hopping robots. A region of study that needs to be studied as hopping systems reach new speeds and heights, and ballistic assumptions (i.e., no thrust, no drag) fail. Presenting an optimized Kalman filter estimation technique, requiring only accelerometer input while minimizing computational and weight load. Ultimately, enabling direct hopping height control and achieving a mean absolute percent error on the hop height of 12.5\%. A final study begins entering higher dynamic horizontal motion with an improved controller design. Prior studies used PiD control and centered on vertical hopping, now expanding to a model-based Lyapunov control. The work shows that the robot can handle disturbances and complex trajectories without sacrificing vertical height, thanks to the guaranteed stability and model-based control offered with the new controller. All works improve the hopping robots' capabilities and push the bounds of what hopping robots can do and explore.
